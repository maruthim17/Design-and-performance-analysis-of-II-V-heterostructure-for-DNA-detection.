## Extended Project Abstract  

DNA detection with high sensitivity and accuracy is crucial for applications such as medical diagnostics, genetic research, and disease monitoring. This project investigates the design and performance of III-V semiconductor heterostructures, including materials like GaAs, InP, and GaN, known for superior electronic properties.  

Key aspects include:  
- Functionalizing semiconductor surfaces for selective DNA hybridization.  
- Minimizing surface defects to enhance charge transfer efficiency.  
- Utilizing advanced simulations and experimental techniques to study material properties, configurations, and fabrication processes.  

Integration of nanostructures (e.g., quantum dots, nanowires) further enhanced detection capabilities. This project aims to develop portable, cost-effective tools for real-time DNA analysis, contributing to precision medicine, environmental monitoring, and biosecurity. Future work will focus on detecting other biomolecules and enhancing robustness in diverse environments.
